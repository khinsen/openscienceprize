The Pitch
=========

Humans communicate with each other through narratives. In order to be useful to humans,
data, computations and visualisations need to be embedded into a story.

Reproducibility, reusability, and remixability are fundamental to the
scientific process.

We propose to make reusability and composition a first-class citizen
in computer aided research by enabling the publication of dynamic and
interactive scientific narratives that can be verified, altered,
reused, and cited.

Specifically, we will do this by:

* developing a simple specification for dependencies, code execution,
  data/parameter inputs, and data/paper outputs.  This specification
  will initially be designed to allow services like
  [mybinder](http://mybinder.org/) and
  [everware](https://betatim.github.io/posts/project-everware-reusable-science/)
  to execute workflows;

* implementing command-line software and Web interfaces to create,
  configure, and execute (locally or remotely) scientific repositories
  that provide this specification;

* extending the current [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/)-based systems to also interact with
  [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) and work within the R ecosystem more cleanly;

* integrating our implementation with [GitHub](http://github.com/), continuous integration,
  and pull requests, to facilitate review, interaction, and collaboration;

* integrating our implementation with [Zenodo](http://zenodo.org/), to provide DOIs for 
  citation;

* prototyping ideas for composition of repositories;

* engaging with the larger academic community including scientists,
  publishers, and librarians around executable papers and workflows
  and specifications for same;
